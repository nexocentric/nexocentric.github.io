        <h2>A Jam Packed Sunday</h2>

        <p>Yesterday, I made a decision—I needed a new soundtrack. Not just any music, but something fresh, something electric. So, I sat down at my desk, fired up my software, and started mixing. Twenty minutes in, I realized something: I was starving.</p>

        <p>Now, I could have cooked, but why use time for that? Instead, I wanted something better, something that got me moving. So I threw on my jacket, laced up my rollerblades, and headed toward my favorite brunch spot. (Huevos Rancheros > everything.) It wasn’t just about food though. It was a chance to get out, keep up with my training, and enjoy the city without staying cramped indoors.</p>

        <p>Halfway there, a track started playing in my head. You know, that deep base that makes you want to move. Before I knew it, I was bustin’ out moves like I had my own private dance floor. A couple people looked my way, probably wondering if I was onto something or just out of my mind lol.</p>

        <p>At brunch, I sit back, relax and think about some ideas for my next project. No rush, no agenda—just a moment to enjoy.</p>

        <p>They say the world will break your heart ten ways to Sunday. Good thing Sunday comes with brunch.</p>

        <h2>Background</h2>

        <p>I’m a tech-savvy creative with a passion for cosplay, anime, and all things geek culture. My IT skills come in very handy for creative projects and business ventures. I produce music and have an eclectic taste from EDM to country. If you’re into deep sci-fi dives, gaming rivalries, and the idea of a weeb power couple, we might just be a perfect match.</p>

I believe in mutual understanding in romantic relationships where both partners feel heard, valued, and respected. I’m all about building strong, supportive connections while allowing space for individuality.</p>

            <li>Big anime fan—Gundam has my heart, but I’m always open to new recommendations</li>
            <li>Sci-fi and space-themed shows are my go-to (because robots and the universe are objectively cool)</li>
            <li>Board game enthusiast—strategy, co-op, or just pure chaos, I’m in</li>
            <li>Video games are a staple</li>
            <li>Music producer in my free time—dabbling in future bass, dubstep, electro swing, and pop</li>
            <li>Love a good trivia night, especially if there’s a competitive edge</li>
            <li>Deep conversations about philosophy, tech, or which anime protagonist had the best character arc</li>

            <li>Volleyball, ice hockey, kickball</li>

        <h2>Why We Might Just Be a Good Match</h2>

        <p>Here’s how I show up:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Loyalty and Connection: I’m committed when it comes to relationships. I value building a bond with someone who can be both a good friend but a better partner. If you’re someone who loves to stick by the people you care about, we’re already in sync.</li>
          <li>Adaptability: Life’s unpredictable, and that’s part of the fun. I love finding solutions when things don’t go according to plan. If you’re someone who knows how to roll with the punches and keep things moving, we’ll get along just fine.</li>
          <li>Peaceful, Low-Key Vibes: I value a peaceful, calm atmosphere where we both feel heard and respected. If you’re the kind of person who’s down to solve problems rather than dwell on them, we’ll have no shortage of great conversations.</li>
          <li>Affection and Connection: I’m affectionate in my own way—whether it’s through a hug, a quick text, or showing you how much I appreciate you. If you’re someone who values physical affection and emotional depth, we’re speaking the same love language.</li>
          <li>Gratitude for the Little Things: I appreciate the simple pleasures in life—the small wins, the quiet moments, the laugh-so-hard-your-stomach-hurts kind of laugh. If you’re someone who can appreciate both the highs and the everyday moments, we’ll have a lot to look forward to.</li>
          <li>Provider Mentality with Mutual Respect: I’m financially stable and enjoy taking on the role of a provider, but for me, it’s all about mutual respect and shared responsibility. I believe in supporting each other and building a life together where we both contribute in our own ways. That can be emotionally, practically, or financially. If you value a balanced partnership where we uplift and take care of one another, we’ll be on the same page.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Dating me comes with a few guarantees: variety of music, great conversation, and a whole lot of Fun.</p>
        
        <p>My world is built on rhythm—whether it’s rollerblading through the city, getting lost in a late-night anime binge, or hitting the dance floor with someone who knows how to follow a lead. I don’t need a perfect dancer, just someone who enjoys the music as much as I do.</p>

        <p>I’m drawn to people who know how to enjoy the moment. Someone who doesn’t overthink things but also knows what they want. If you can laugh at a dumb joke, stay up way too late talking about everything and nothing, and have a bit of a mischievous streak—you’re my kind of person.</p>

        <p>A great relationship isn’t just about fun (though, let’s be real, that part is important). It’s about connection, trust, and knowing we can talk about anything—even the things that matter most. Whether it’s leveling up in life or just in a co-op game, I want someone who can handle nerdy debates, serious conversations, and those quiet moments where words aren’t even necessary.</p>

        <p>If you’re someone who knows what they want, who loves affection, and who understands that the best relationships have a little bit of fire and a whole lot of peace. I want to meet you.</p>

        <h2>What I’m Looking For</h2>

        <p>Someone who:</p>

        <p>Embraces spontaneity, enjoys a good laugh, and isn’t afraid to get deep when it matters.</p>

        <p>Shares an appreciation for creativity and geek culture, which is a key part of who I am. If you’re into anime, gaming, cosplay, or similar interests, we’re already speaking the same language.</p>

        <p>Values communication, respect, and building something real together.</p>

        <p>I’m not here for games (well, unless we’re talking video or board games). In all seriousness, I’m looking for something real, something that lasts. I want someone who gets that a great relationship is built in the small moments…laughing at something ridiculous, getting way too into a game, or having the kind of conversation that keeps you out later than you planned. Someone who’s comfortable in their own skin, enjoys a little nerdy fun, and doesn’t mind that I take my anime seriously.</p>

        <p>I’m drawn to people who are confident in their own skin, have passions they pursue and are open to new experiences without needing constant novelty. What I’m looking for is a partner who shares a similar mindset: Someone who values loyalty, knows how to adapt, and seeks a peaceful, supportive connection. So if you’re looking for a nerdy boyfriend who loves sci-fi and deep conversations and you’re into anime, and a bit of adventure mixed with quiet nights in, then we might just be onto something great.</p>

        <p>So.....if you love affection, can appreciate a great game night, and don’t mind a little friendly competition at the bowling alley, what are we waiting for?</p>

        <h2>A Brief Little How-Do-You-Do From Me</h2>

        <p class="compatiblity-greater-than-30">I’m a homegrown Midwesterner—born in Stillwater, Oklahoma, bounced around Minnesota and Illinois, and finally made my way back to Oklahoma in 2017. Add in a decade living in Japan (Nagoya to be exact), where I earned an MBA in computer science entirely in Japanese, and you’ve got someone who thrives on challenges, adapting to whatever comes next, and doing things on my own terms.</p>

        <p>Style is my thing. Lately, I’ve been into cowboy boots because, why not mix tradition with something unique? At first glance, I might seem like a regular guy or a “normie,” but I connect most with creative and quirky people. Those are my people.</p>

        <p>Music and dancing fuel me up. If there's a beat, I’m moving. When I’m not on the dance floor, I’m producing music or diving into anime and manga—yes, in Japanese. I enjoy sports like volleyball, ice hockey, tennis, and bowling, but I prefer playing over watching,</p>

        <p class="compatiblity-greater-than-30">I’m the oldest of three, and while I value my independence, family has helped me grow. I’ve carved my own path and I stand firm, but I’m also there for the people I care about. Autonomy’s important, but so is appreciating the people and experiences that have shaped me.</p>

        <p>I’ve got plenty of stories, but I won’t overload you. My life’s an open book, so if you're curious, just ask. Or Google me. You might find something fun. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6o3OMyWgnpU</p>

          <li>I’m an ambivert—social, outgoing, and always up for a good conversation, but I also know the value of downtime. I’d love someone who’s open to meeting my friends and being part of my world. If you’re more on the introverted side, that’s cool—I won’t drag you to every event, but I’ll always save you a seat when you’re up for it.</li>

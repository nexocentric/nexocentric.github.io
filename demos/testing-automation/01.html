				Element selectors are everywhere. They are all around us. Even now, in this very meeting. You can see it when you look out your window or when you turn on your television. You can feel it when you go to work... when you go to church... when you pay your taxes. It is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth.

						This is your last chance. After this, there is no turning back. You take the blue pill – the automation ends, you wake up in your bed and on another support call in the middle of the night. You take the red pill – you stay in automation land, and I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes. Remember, all I'm offering are better element selectors – nothing more.

        <h2>Hey, I’m Dodzi</h2>
        
        <p>Glad you’re here! As you’ve probably noticed, this isn’t just another dating profile; it’s a glimpse into the life of someone who blends style with substance, anime fandom with real-world ambition, and a love for dancing with a grounded sense of autonomy. If you’re ready to press start on something real, keep reading!</p>

      <section class="section is-large">
        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p><span class="compatiblity-greater-than-30">I was born in Stillwater, Oklahoma, but my roots stretch all the way to Ghana. Raised in Minnesota and Illinois, life eventually brought me back to Oklahoma in 2017 for work. In between, </span>I spent 10 years living in Japan, earning my MBA in Computer Science from the Aichi Institute of Technology. Yes, the classes were all in Japanese, and yes, I’m still pretty proud of that.</p>

        <h3>Who I Am</h3>

        <p>Think of me as the friendly, upbeat guy who’s equal parts curious nerd and practical realist. I dive deep into my multitude of interests, whether it’s dissecting the latest sci-fi series, exploring the nuances of multi-player video games, or ranking episodes of Solo Leveling! When I’m not geeking out, I’m probably out for a walk, rollerblading, or getting lost in a good book.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="section is-large">
        <h2>My Core Values</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>Mastery: I aim to get better at everything I do.</li>
          <li>Enjoyment: Life’s too short not to have fun.</li>
          <li>Autonomy: I value independence and self-sufficiency.</li>
          <li>Imagination: I’m always exploring new ideas and possibilities.</li>
          <li>Gratitude: I appreciate the people and experiences that shape my life.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Those values shape who I am, but it’s also important to explore how they show up in everyday life. Because they’re the lens I view the world through, my core values set the tone for my work ethic, personal development, and close relationships.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="section is-large">
        <h2>A Little More About Me</h2>

        <p>Friends often describe me as easygoing and socially adaptable, with a wide range of interests. I’m a style-focused guy who’s into fashion (yes, I collect cowboy boots, and yes, they’re awesome). I love dancing, playing sports (especially volleyball and ice hockey), and reading Japanese manga in its original language.</p>

        <p>My appearance might suggest I’m a "normie," but anyone who knows me understands that my inner circle is full of fellow geeks, nerds, and creative spirits. I’m a weeb at heart and proud of it.</p>

        <h2>Some Quirky Facts</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>Mass Effect is my masterpiece. It's sci-fi, it's gaming, it's storytelling perfection. Yes, my friends are tired of hearing about it. No, I’m not stopping.</li>
          <li>Isaac Asimov’s Foundation series? Absolute genius. If you like your sci-fi with a side of societal evolution, we’ll get along just fine.</li>
          <li>I’m technically a samurai (no, really!) I’ve trained in Japanese sword arts (Iaido) and hold a Level 2 certification. Yes, there’s video proof: Watch here.</li>
          <li>Public speaking is my thing. Some people fear it—I thrive on it. There’s something thrilling about commanding a room.</li>
          <li>No coffee, no regrets. While everyone’s debating oat milk vs. almond milk, I’m just over here enjoying the vast breath and depth that are provided by fresh, looseleaf teas.</li>
          <li>I love couch co-op video games. Teamwork builds bonds. I’d love to build a deeper connection with you while tackling the challenges of a couch co-op gaming session—A couple that plays together, stays together. If you’re playing with me, you can be that I’ll be staying with you.</li>
          <li>Rollerblading over running any day. Why sprint when you can glide?</li>
          <li>I don’t just follow sci-fi—I live it. If it has space travel, AI, or an existential crisis about humanity’s future, I’m in.</li>
          <li>I am a professional cat herder EDS, an HP Company 'Cat Herders' (A.K.A a cloud engineer).</li>
        </ul>

        <p>If this sounds like the kind of connection you’re looking for, let’s hit start and see where the adventure takes us.</p>
      </section>
      
      <section class="section is-large">
        <h2>The Deeper Layers</h2>

        <p>Beyond the fun facts, I’m someone who values empathy and integrity. I believe that being present, truly listening, and showing up for the people who matter are what set meaningful relationships apart from fleeting encounters. If you’re someone who appreciates thoughtful gestures and small acts of kindness, we’re already off to a good start.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="section is-large">
        <h2>What I’m Looking For</h2>

        <p>I’m not here for surface-level swiping—I’m looking for genuine chemistry built on shared interests, deep conversations, and a whole lot of laughter. </p>

        <p>A great connection, to me, feels like an inside joke that never gets old and a safe space where we can both be unapologetically ourselves. Picture this: You and I immersed in the period-appropriate aesthetic at RenFaire, taking in some jousting, and turning heads with our killer coordinated costumes. I really enjoy niche communities built on shared passions and expressed creativity, so I’m hoping you do too!</p>

        <h3>You Might Be My Player 2 If</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>You love thoughtful discussions about anything from the latest cosplay trends to the ramifications on real life of a Netflix docuseries.</li>
          <li>You appreciate nerdy jokes (or at least humor them with a smile).</li>
          <li>You value authenticity and aren’t afraid to embrace your quirks.</li>
          <li>You’re curious about the world and always eager to learn something new.</li>
          <li>You believe that compassion and kindness are strengths, not weaknesses.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Bonus Points If</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>You’ve got a competitive streak but can still appreciate a good game even if you lose.</li>
          <li>You enjoy going on spontaneous adventures, whether that’s a convention day trip or an impromptu board game marathon.</li>
          <li>You can teach me something new—whether it’s a hobby, a fun fact, or just a different perspective on life.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="section is-large">
        <h2>Relationship Expectations</h2>

        <p>I believe the best relationships are built on mutual respect, open communication, and a shared sense of curiosity. I’m looking for a partner who’s comfortable being both independent and supportive—someone who understands that a healthy relationship is about growing together while allowing space for individuality. And it probably goes without saying, but let’s be honest and open about feelings, needs, and boundaries!</p>

        <h3>Here’s What Matters Most</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>Lives in the Moment: Let’s be here and now, in our personal lives and with each other, not stuck in the past or fixated on the future.</li>
          <li>Support: Encouraging each other’s passions and celebrating wins, generous physical affection, and consistent acts of service.</li>
          <li>Shared Experiences: Whether it’s a quiet night in or a spontaneous road trip, the best memories are made together.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>I’m not expecting perfection—just someone willing to show up, try, and be present.</p>

      <section class="section is-large">
        <h2>Deal-Breakers</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>Inability to Commit: Whether to a relationship, avocation, or workout regimen, the ability to see something through with dedication and diligence is a must-have.</li>
          <li>Close-mindedness: A lack of curiosity or an unwillingness to try new things doesn’t mesh well with my vibe.</li>
          <li>Game-Playing (the bad kind): I’m not into emotional games or mixed signals—clarity and respect go a long way.</li>
          <li>Friendly Fire: If you’re suspicious or jealous of the bonds I have with my friends, you and I are NOT going to make it past “go”.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="section is-large">
        <h2>What’s Our Next Step</h2>

        <p>Send me a message and tell me about the last book you couldn’t put down, the game that’s been eating up all your free time, or even a random fact you think I should know. If nothing else, I promise a great conversation—and maybe, just maybe, we’ll find out if you’re the Player 2 I’ve been waiting for!</p>

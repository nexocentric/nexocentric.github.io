        <h2>About Me: The Tech Specs</h2>

        <p>If you have come here, you probably already know my name is Dodzidenu (Dodzi). For those interested in getting to know me, this page is a great start. I am a full-stack developer (among other things) so it only made sense to harness the power of the web page to give you an insight into my personality, aspirations and relationship goals.</p>

        <p>It’s OK if you think a full-stack is a generous serving of pancakes. My partner doesn’t have to understand the technical side of my job, just support me as my career grows. I also have an unwavering love for a good brunch, so pancakes are a plus.</p>
        
        <p>I consider time to be very valuable, and spend it exploring a variety of interests, including gaming, anime, cosplaying, dancing, and music production. My goal for this page is to skip the mismatched dates and “pick me” dating profiles and instead, find a fellow weeb who can see themselves potentially spending some of that quality time with me based on what they read here. I have covered a lot of topics, from music to manga and fitness to family. If you like what you read or have more questions – get in touch!</p>

        <h2>The Bio Basics</h2>

        <p class="compatiblity-greater-than-30">My parents are from Ghana. I was born in Stillwater, Oklahoma. But I only spent the first 6 months of my life in Oklahoma. I was raised in Minnesota and Illinois, and then ended up moving back to Oklahoma in 2017 for work. Before that, I completed my undergraduate studies at the University of Iowa and then spent about 10 years in Nagoya, where I went to graduate school for an MBA in computer science at the Aichi Institute of Technology. All my classes were in Japanese, and I absolutely love Japanese culture and traditions. I have travelled and seen enough to know that lots of people are always looking out for a greener grass, but I tend to see that if I water the area around me, I get the green I need right where I’m at. Now I would like to find someone who is ready to grow and blossom alongside me.</p>

      <section class="section is-large">
        <h2>My Personality</h2>

        <p>These values are the pillars of my personality and are the foundation of the lifestyle I have built.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p><span>Mastery</span>I strive for mastery in my pursuits, whether it’s in my work as a technology expert or music engineer. Spending 10 years in Japan gave me an even greater insight into cultures that truly do each job with a sense of honor, and I put the extra effort in to learn and master skills at work, in the gym and even the dance floor! </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><span>Enjoyment</span>Life should be enjoyable, so I make it a point to indulge in experiences that bring joy—like heading out for brunch or dancing the night away with friends. I am a geek at heart but not your stereotypical introvert. On the contrary, I enjoy playing sports like ice hockey, volleyball and tennis and I am always keen for a coffee date with friends (although I am a tea lover).</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><span>Autonomy</span>I always strived to be autonomous and worked hard to build a life that could not defined by the expectations, traditions or desires of others – including society and family. I care for my family, but I am my own person. I want a partner who is also happy to enrich each other’s lives while still nurturing the things that fulfil us independently.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><span>Imagination</span>I am a creative and my imagination knows no bounds. I have always been told that I have a good sense of style and a flair for fashion (I am currently rocking a very cool collection of cowboy boots). In that sense, I have been labelled a “normie”, but the truth is that my imagination is at it’s peak when I am at cosplay conferences, renaissance fairs, watching anime and space-themed shows, gaming and deep diving into Japanese manga.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><span>Gratitude</span>I practice gratitude daily. It helps me appreciate the little things. I am very grateful for my friends, my health and my freedom to be my own boss and build a career that I am passionate about. I find that gratitude, like happiness, is multiplied in good relationships because it grows when shared.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="section is-large">
        <h2>Hobbies and Interests</h2>

        <p>I have a wide range of hobbies and interests, and I love sharing them with someone who can either join in or appreciate them. In fact, this is probably one of the most important things that I am looking for in a partner.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <h3>Gaming & Anime Culture</h3>
            <p>I’m a huge anime and gaming fan, and I’d love to find someone who enjoys or at least respects weeb culture. I’m particularly into mecha anime like Gundam, Code Geass, Gurren Lagann, Macross, and Knights & Magic. Sci-fi and fantasy themes are my favorites, but I’m open to different genres, I just don don’t enjoy horror, but no judgement if you do!</p>
            
            <p class="compatiblity-greater-than-30">Gaming is another big part of my life. I enjoy a mix of video games, board games, and tabletop role-playing games (TTRPGs). I don’t expect my partner to be a hardcore gamer, but it would be great if you were open to playing the occasional co-op game or joining a board game night with friends. I have a rich social life, and it is important for me for my partner to get along with my friends, but also for them to have their own circle that they can spend time with independently. </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Japanese Language</h3>
            <p>An interest in Japanese is a major green flag for me! If you're learning Japanese for fun, had it as a college major, dabbling in it on Duolingo or are completely fluent, we're sure to have a great time. I completely support language nerds at any level of their journey and it would be great to be a part of your learning. The Japanese language is fun and fascinating, so it would be very special to explore it together!</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Music & Dancing</h3>
            <p>Music is a big part of my life. I produce EDM, dubstep, future bass, electro swing, and pop music, and I’ve even released a few EPs. I have an eclectic taste in music, from K-Pop and J-Pop to hard rock and country (yes, COUNTRY), mostly because I love two-step dancing. I’ve been taking lessons in two-step, nightclub two-step, shuffle, and country waltz. I love going out dancing, and it would be amazing if my partner was open to learning and dancing with me. If you’re already into dancing, even better!</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Cosplay, Renaissance Fairs & Conventions</h3>
            <p>I really enjoy cosplay and fantasy events, like anime conventions and Renaissance fairs. While I don’t cosplay all the time, I love dressing up for Halloween, RenFaires, and conventions. This hobby brings me a lot of joy, so the minimum is to find someone who is open to experiencing it with no judgement. Sharing the experience with a fellow cosplay lover would be even more fulfilling. </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Technology & Creative Projects</h3>
            <p>I’m a full-stack developer and love working on personal tech projects, music production, and digital art. I constantly strive to improve and learn new things, whether it’s coding, producing music, or creating art. I live by the philosophy that a lot of where you get to comes down to putting in the effort consistently over time, so that the times that you get lucky, you're ready for that luck. My goal is to build my professional brand as a public speaker in the tech space. I have a bit of an obsessive drive when I get into something, so if you’re someone who also enjoys learning and growing, we’ll probably get along great.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Fitness & Sports</h3>
            <p>I enjoy staying active and I work out 4-5 days a week. I also love rollerblading and am currently training for a skating marathon. On top of that, I enjoy playing ice hockey, volleyball, and tennis. Fun fact – I completed level 2 Samurai training in Japan, which was both a thrill and honor. I am not an avid spectator of sports, so you won’t hear me discussing the weekend games, unless it is the occasional ice hockey match.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Social Life</h3>
            <p>Brunch is a weekly tradition for me—I try to go every weekend. I also love spending time with friends, whether it’s for game nights, trivia nights, or just hanging out. I also love a good night out dancing, or a fun trip to a convention, fair or other event, I don’t need to be out all the time, though—I also love staying in, working on my projects, or watching anime. I also love the thrill of amusement parks, with Six Flags Saint-Louis and Busch Gardens being some of my favorites. Roller coasters and exciting rides? Count me in!</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Sci-Fi & Space Enthusiasm</h3>
            <p>I am fascinated by science fiction, space, and robotics. Mass Effect is one of my favorite stories of all time, and The Foundation series by Isaac Asimov is another personal favorite. If I ever had the chance, I’d love to travel into space and see TON 618—the largest known black hole. I enjoy reading sci-fi books and manga, especially ones with deep philosophical or futuristic themes.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="section is-large">
        <h2>About You</h2>

        <p>How could I possibly have an “About You” page when we haven’t met? Well, this is the realistic, raw and honest perspective of how I envision my future partner. We all know chemistry, connection and emotions will reign, but I do have a clear idea of the characteristics that would make for a strong, long-term relationship. If you can recognize yourself among these words, we are already off to a great start.</p>

        <div>
          <h3>Numbers</h3>
          <p class="compatiblity-greater-than-30">When it comes to age range, I am open minded. The ideal bracket would be 20-33, but I am open to exploring a connection with someone who is up to 50 years old. The more significant number in my mind is our overlap of interests and values. Ideally, I would like to share about 75% of what is on this page with you. Most importantly, you should be mature enough (at whatever age) to know what you want, like and stand for. Someone who is confident in themselves and doesn’t seek validation from others and social media.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3>Personality & Values</h3>
          <p>It’s important for me to find someone who shares my core values and so I am looking for someone loyal and who is not afraid to show affection and gratitude. I’m an ambivert, meaning I’m highly social but also enjoy my alone time. I’d love a partner who can hold their own in social situations, get along with my friends, and is comfortable making new connections. I am a big believer in the growth mindset and so you should be open to learning new things, whether that’s dancing, gaming, or just picking up new skills together.</p>

          <p>Blame it on 10 years in Japan, but my home is a Zen zone, and I like to keep the drama out. I value peace and stability, so I am looking for a partner who is logical and emotionally stable—I appreciate someone who can handle conflict through calm discussion and compromise, rather than emotional outbursts or passive-aggressiveness.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div>
          <h3>Interests</h3>
          <p>While we don’t have to share all the same hobbies, I would appreciate someone who can socially adapt and be open-minded and non-judgmental, especially when it comes to my hobbies and interests.</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <p><span>Gaming, anime, or weeb culture</span> You don’t have to be a hardcore fan, but I’d love someone who enjoys at least some of it and won’t look down on my interests. I love all things Japanese, so knowledge or even just appreciation of the language and culture is a green flag. If these are things you look down on or are dismissive of, we are definitely not a good fit.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><span>Cosplay or dressing up for events</span> like RenFaires, Halloween, or anime conventions. If you’re an active cosplayer, even better—I’d love to support you with my tech skills! If this is all new to you, that is fine too, if you keep an open mind and are willing to explore it as a fun experience.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><span>Music and dancing</span> take two-step, shuffle, and country waltz lessons, so if you’re into dancing or open to learning, we’d have a great time together. I don’t plan on competing or anything, so it is just a bit of fun and not to be taken too seriously.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><span>Fitness and staying active</span> I work out regularly and am training for a skating marathon, so I’d love a partner who also invests time and effort into their health and fitness.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div>
          <h3>Politics and Social Problems</h3>
          <p>If your political view is 100% of your identity and reason for being, then we won't vibe. I appreciate the importance of being informed and involved (voting) but I don’t believe political ideology should define a person, whether they’re right, left, authoritarian, or socialist. I've lived as a minority in two different countries and experienced my own fair share of various -isms. My philosophy is to live every day striving to be the best person I can be for my friends and loved ones, while respecting the nuanced stances and the grey areas we all dwell in as humans. I'd expect my partner to share this quality.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div>
          <h3>Lifestyle & Relationship Dynamics</h3>
          <p>You are someone who:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <p class="compatiblity-greater-than-30"><span>Respects independence</span> I have my own interests, work, and social life, and I expect my partner to have theirs too. I believe that time apart makes the time together even better. Of course, I would love to share my traditional weekend brunch dates with you, have you as a partner on Monday game nights or cozy-up on the couch for late night sci fi marathons – but I also think our lives should complement each other, not be co-dependent daily.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p class="compatiblity-greater-than-30"><span>Supports a traditional but flexible household dynamic</span> I’m willing to be the main financial provider, so I prefer a partner who isn’t overly career-driven but enjoys contributing to the household in other ways. You are ready to share household chores and don’t mind cooking for two.  If you have a passion that you have built into a self-employed model, like cosplay, art, translation, or small business ownership, I’d fully support that.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p class="compatiblity-greater-than-30"><span>Keeps a peaceful home environment</span> I don’t bring drama from work or friends into my home, and I’d like a partner who does the same. A strong routine and stability are important to me, and I don’t equate “boring” with “bad”—sometimes, a quiet, drama-free relationship is the best kind (like I said – Zen zone!).</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div>
          <h3>Affection</h3>
          <p class="compatiblity-greater-than-30">If physical touch is one of your love languages, you will appreciate the small gestures that allow us to feel connected. I.e. hugs, handholding, sitting close and openly showing (PG rated) affection in public. I will sit next to you, and we can hold and caress hands in a restaurant booth, but we are both mindful of people trying to eat around us!</p>
          
          <p class="compatiblity-greater-than-30">In terms of physical intimacy behind closed doors, I value direct conversations about what works and what doesn’t, and I’d love a partner who can talk about these things without awkwardness. There should be no taboos in our bedroom – from sex to snoring (FYI it helps if you are a heavy sleeper because I am up at 5am and not the quietest of sleepers). Physical intimacy is essential for me in a relationship.</p>

        <h2>Relationships</h2>
        <p>I believe that a good relationship helps us grow as individuals, while the wrong choice of partner can negatively impact on every segment of your life. Over the years, I have come to realize that we, as partners, need to choose each other, and this can only happen when we truly know what we want from the other person and what we are bringing to the relationship. Here is what I have discovered so far about my relationship style and goals.</p>

        <div>
          <h2>Monogamy</h2>
          <p>Monogamy is a non-negotiable point for me. I’m not interested in polyamory in any way, shape or form. My perception of polyamory is that it is a result of commitment issues, fear of missing out and a general avoidance of bonding and responsibility. <span class="compatiblity-greater-than-30">I am not looking to waste each other's time while you try to convince me otherwise, so please reach out only if you share the conviction that physical intimacy should be reserved solely for one partner.</span></p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2>Communication Style</h2>
          <p>I am generally a calm and collected person, so I like to communicate calmly without emotional outbursts or arguments. Sometimes this means taking a step back to cool down and returning to the conversation with a solution-based mindset.  One of the most common pitfalls of relationships is a lack of honesty (with each other, but also with ourselves), so I find it is very important to be clear about your needs and expectations and to avoid making assumptions that ultimately lead to disappointment. The truth is not always pleasant, but I truly value honestly and constructive dialogue.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2>Daily Routines & Lifestyle</h2>
          <p class="compatiblity-greater-than-30">I prefer a structured lifestyle that sets the ground for progress. I believe commitment to any goal is essential, so routines are important (with added room for a bit of flexibility). As I have mentioned, I am a morning person and my day starts at 5am with full energy and a good workout. It is always great to share this energy and love of fitness with a partner as it helps us stay on the same wavelength. There needs to be a good balance, so I also find that a relationship should include plenty of down time like getting a bite to eat, watching anime, gaming etc.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2>Social Activities</h2>
          <p>I like to go out with my partner once or twice a month, but most of my hobbies are home-based. I am also interested in board games and card games that my partner and I can use that to bond that works enough for me. I have a great group of friends, and I happily introduce my partners to them, but it is very important for me to also have independent time with my friends. I like for both of us to have a fulfilled life and respect each other’s quality time with people outside of our relationship.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2>Friends & Relationships</h2>
          <p>I believe that great relationships have some level of cross-interaction with mutual friends. My friends are nerdy, so being ready to embrace nerd culture in some shape or form is paramount for a great relationship. You don't have to be a nerd right now, but you should be open minded, curious and non-judgemental. When people step outside of the stereotypes, they soon realize there is a nerdy side to most of us!</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2>Intimacy & Affection</h2>
          <p class="compatiblity-greater-than-30">Our relationship should be openly affectionate, with constant physical intimacy being a priority. I am not one to shy away from public displays of affection like hugging and holding hands and I believe the small gestures all play a big part in building intimacy and a healthy sex life. I like to nurture open communication about sex and intimacy and appreciate a partner that can initiate and reciprocate the affection – taking turns to lead. </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2>Long Distance Relationships</h2>
          <p class="compatiblity-greater-than-30">If we are a good fit or if you think we could be a great fit, I'm open to long distance relationships temporarily in the short-term. You are awesome and your awesomeness may not exist where I currently reside. However, once we decided to commit I would want to close the distances as soon as possible. While absence makes the heart grow fonder, shared experiences strengthen bonds.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2>Role Expectations & Household Dynamics</h2>
          <p class="compatiblity-greater-than-30">I can honestly say that I prefer a dynamic in which my partner takes on more of a homemaker role so that I can focus on achieving the financial independence for us to enjoy life without worrying about money.  I am more than willing to financially support my partner in pursuing a passion profession or small business such as cosplaying, translation, art etc. In terms of household chores, I also contribute to the running of the household (laundry, vacuuming etc.) but appreciate a partner who can cook and make the house a home (preferably clutter-free and more minimalist oriented with some cool pieces we choose together).</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2>Family and the Future</h2>
          <p class="compatiblity-greater-than-30">I grew up in an American-Ghanian family with 2 sisters and although I am grateful for the love and memories, I became autonomous very early on and don’t consider myself very close to my family. I love them and help whenever I can, but I find that the friends and relationships you forge end up becoming your actual immediate family. When I envision my future, it is as a happy, successful and content couple with the financial and lifestyle freedom to travel, explore, indulge in new experiences and grow together without the responsibility of children or high-maintenance pets at home.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2>The security behind a softer life</h2>
          <p>When life is challenging and knocks you around, you tend to create an armor and everything, including yourself, becomes harder. I am ready for a partner who is ready to embrace a softer side of life together, one where we uplift each other to pursue passions and rise to every challenge knowing we are not alone, because - It's dangerous to go alone! https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It%27s_dangerous_to_go_alone)</p>

          <h3>FAQ</h3>
          <p>These tend to be the topics people tiptoe around, yet they can be major dealbreakers. I prefer to be honest and upfront – what you see is what you get. Here are my honest stances on the big questions.</p>

I've lived as a minority in two different countries and have had my own fair share of various -isms. I always strive to be the best I can be at the moment at the time for my friends and loved ones while respecting the nuanced stances in the grey as well all have as humans. I'd expect my partner to be the same.</p>

That’s where I tend to live. I do like access to things in the city like restaurants, clubs, and some events. However, I really like exploring my locale.</p>

            <p>I think social media is really bad for many reasons and I stay off of it as much as possible. I have Instagram, but primarily use it for keeping my pulse on what younger ages are into when it comes to music and nerd culture. I do occasionally send the random meme as well. If you're using social media to keep up with the Jones', or gain external validation, we're going to have a tough time meshing. Rarely using social media is a green flag in my book.</p>

I am not interested in polyamory in anyway shape or form. There are things that I do with my friends and things that I will only do with my partner. There is room and time for both my partner and friends, but physically intimacy is only for my partner.</p>
